p.28 We can define corporate governance as “a toolkit that enables management and the board to deal more 
effectively with the challenges of running a company. Corporate governance ensures that businesses have 
appropriate decision-making processes and controls in place so that the interests of all stakeholders are 
balanced.” (This definition is taken from https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/.)
A strong corporate governance framework can assist you in meeting the requirements of laws and 
regulations such as GDPR, that is, the European privacy law.
GDPR, for example, requires data controllers and processors to verify compliance with its standards 
through specific documentation, such as applicable logs, rules, and procedures.
Throughout this book, I will use examples from GDPR, although there are several other legislations 
around, such as LGPD (the Brazilian privacy law) or CCPA from California, and many more about to 
come. But GDPR is, with the UK variant, an umbrella for roughly 400 million people in 28 countries 
and therefore, the most popular. 
Using IT governance aspects will assist you in creating and maintaining proper policies and procedures 
to help satisfy your data privacy obligations.
IT governance is a component of corporate governance that aims to improve overall IT management 
and get more value from investments in information and technology.

p.29 IT governance frameworks have the following functions:
• Assisting entities in efficiently managing their IT risks and ensuring that information and 
technology operations are aligned with their overall business objectives
• Showing demonstrable achievements in relation to broader business plans and goals
• Complying with applicable legal and regulatory duties, such as those outlined in GDPR
• Assuring stakeholders that your entity’s IT services are trustworthy
• Facilitating a higher return on IT investment
• Following any business governance or public listing guidelines or procedures
According to ISACA (https://www.isaca.org), we can break IT governance (ISO 38500) 
into five different domains:
• Value delivery
• Strategic alignment
• Performance management
• Resource management
• Risk management
Consider that there are several frameworks and methodologies to comply with IT governance, such
as ISO 27001, NIST, ISO 27000 (aka ITIL), COBIT, ISO 31000, ISO 38500, and ISO 22301. Since we 
are dealing with a security compliance framework, it would be better to stick to the most popular, 
that is, ISO27001 and NIST, alongside ISO 27701 (privacy framework).

p.31 The goal of the incident management procedure is to restore normal service operation as soon as 
possible and to minimize the negative effect on business activities while maintaining agreed-upon 
standards of service quality. The incident management process’s goals are to do the following:
• Ensure that standardized processes and procedures are utilized for effective and timely incident 
response, analysis, recording, continuous improvement and reporting
• Increase incident visibility and communication to business and IT support personnel
• Improve the business view of IT by taking a professional approach to addressing and communicating 
problems as they might arise
• Align incident management efforts and priorities with business priorities
• Maintain satisfaction among users with IT service quality
So, we conclude a very rapid journey on the essential topics concerning governance. Let’s move on to 
an interesting topic, differences of NIST.

p.31 Differences between ISO 27001 and NIST
As it has fewer controls to implement, and since there’s no control over it (NIST doesn’t have a certification 
scheme), NIST is considered somewhat less mature; also, as it is backed by the US government and not 
an international committee, it is not considered much outside the US. But if you like plain instructions 
and don’t want to spend a fortune, at least in the beginning, it can be a good idea to use NIST. Finally, 
it is possible to get the best of both worlds by implementing both at the same time.

p.42 Controls are a combination of technological, procedural, and behavioral components that work 
together to achieve a specified, recognized, and recorded control goal. For example, your desktop user 
systems are under attack from a harmful combination of viruses, worms, Trojans, and spam, which 
will jeopardize the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of the data on your desktop. Email, online 
browsing, and instant messaging are the attack vectors. Among the controls would be the following:
• Anti-virus and anti-spyware software, anti-spam filters, firewalls, and automated updating are 
examples of technical advances
• Processes including software and firewall configuration, upgrading procedures, incident 
management procedures, and acceptable usage policies
• Behavioral – user awareness and training in dealing with these risks and techniques of reaction, 
such as identifying when malicious software attempts to download into a PC
This three-pronged approach is typical of all successful controls; implementing merely two of them 
exposes a substantial vulnerability that can reverse all that has been put in place. The false sense of 
security that most businesses gain from having only a partial solution in place may be very damaging

p.67 Article 9 of the GDPR contains a comprehensive overview of the specific categories of data:
• Information exposing race or ethnicity
• Information exposing political viewpoints
• Information exposing religious beliefs
• Information exposing philosophical convictions
• Information concerning membership in a labor organization
• Genomic data
• Biometric data (for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person)
• Information on health
• Information pertaining to sexual activity or orientation

p.76 To achieve this purpose, the head of the IT function must prepare an IT security policy, which is an 
organic set of formal rules that define the methods for managing the IT tools and data of the company 
or body in question. The components of the policy are the following:
• Authentication
• Internal and external data integrity
• Data backup
• Host security
• Network security
• Physical security
• The safety of operations
• Configuration management (minimum security profile)
• Alert mechanisms activated on systems (SIEM and similar)
• The operating procedures for changing the policy in the event of unforeseen external events

p.94 Among the advantages of risk management are the following:
• Enhanced risk awareness within the company
• Increased confidence in corporate aims and goals as a result of incorporating risk into strategy
• Compliance coordination results in greater and more efficient compliance with regulatory and 
internal compliance regulations
• Enhanced operational efficiency via the implementation of risk protocols and control more 
consistently
• Increased employee and consumer workplace safety and security
• A distinct competitive advantage in the market
The following are some of the obstacles that risk management teams are likely to face:
• Initially, costs increase because risk management strategies often need costly software and services
• To comply with the growing focus on governance, business units must also devote time and 
money
• Reaching an agreement on the severity of a danger and how to address it may be a tough and 
controversial task that can lead to analytical paralysis in certain cases
• It is difficult to demonstrate the benefit of risk management to executives without concrete figures

p.94 Let’s use the ISO 31000 standard (there are many around, from Committee of Sponsoring Organization, 
COSO (https://www.coso.org/), to eBIOS (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/
topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/riskmanagement-inventory/rm-ra-methods/m_ebios.html, a similar framework sponsored 
by the European Community) but, for sake of simplicity, we are going to utilize something that you 
have already heard of:
• Consultation and communication – Since increasing risk awareness is a crucial component 
of risk management, risk leaders must also design a communication strategy to disseminate 
the organization’s risk policies and procedures to workers and other relevant parties. This stage 
sets the tone for all risk-related choices. The audience consists of anybody interested in how 
the company capitalizes on favorable risks and mitigates negative ones.
78 Security Planning and Risk Management
• Providing the context – This phase entails determining the organization’s specific risk appetite 
and risk tolerance (i.e., the extent by which risk may deviate from risk appetite). Included in these 
considerations are corporate goals, company culture, regulatory laws, and the political climate.
• Risk identification – This stage identifies the risk scenarios that may have a favorable or negative 
effect on the organization’s capacity to do business. As stated before, the resultant list should 
be entered into an up-to-date risk registry.
• Risk analysis – The probability and severity of each risk are examined in order to classify 
them. The creation of a risk heatmap, which gives a visual picture of the nature and effect 
of a company’s risks, might be beneficial in this situation. A worker calling in sick is a highprobability occurrence that has little or no influence on the majority of businesses. Depending 
on its location, an earthquake is an example of a low-probability but high-impact danger.
• Risk assessment – Here, companies consider how to address the threats they confront. 
Techniques consist of at least one of the following:
 Risk Avoidance – The objective of risk avoidance is to remove, withdraw from, or avoid 
possible danger
 Risk Mitigation – The process through which an organization minimizes or optimizes a risk
 Risk Sharing (or Risk Transfer) – The organization contracts with a third party (e.g., an 
insurer) to shoulder some or all of the expenses associated with a risk that may or may not arise
 Risk Acceptance – A risk that fits within the risk appetite and tolerance of the company is 
accepted without action
• Risk Treatment – This phase involves implementing the agreed-upon controls and procedures 
and verifying that they function as intended.
• Monitoring and evaluation – Are the controls operating properly? Can they be made better? 
Monitoring operations should monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and search for key 
risk indicators (KRIs) that might prompt a strategy adjustment.

p.101 The ISO 27001 standard – what it is and what requirements it 
establishes
Annex A of ISO/IEC 27001 contains the objectives and controls, or the thematic areas considered 
and the controls to be applied (the 14 thematic areas are then broken down into lower-level controls, 
more details of which are provided in ISO/IEC27002). The areas, or domains, of the whole ISO/IEC 
27001 are broken up into the following 14 controls:
• A.5: Information security policy
• A.6: Organization of information security
• A.7: Human resource security
• A.8: Asset management
• A.9: Access control
• A.10: Cryptography
• A.11: Physical and environmental security
• A.12: Operation security
• A.13: Communications security
• A.14: System acquisition, development, and maintenance
• A.15: Supplier relationships
• A.16: Information security incident management
• A.17: Information security aspects of business continuity management
• A.18: Compliance
Each of these sections then contains subareas that provide directives without, however, providing 
stringent specifications on the security measures that must be chosen and used in a specific case.

p.104 At the heart of the iSMS is the risk analysis and assessment process, which allows you to assess the 
riskiness of threats and therefore establish possible countermeasures.
In this case, the suggestion is to adopt an approach already used in the company, if present, or to create 
a new one that is simple enough so as not to make the project excessively complicated.
Being able to identify relevant threats and weigh them accurately is a very difficult aspect and typically 
requires coordinated work between security specialists.
Without going into excessive detail, the risk analysis phases must be as follows:
• Risk identification: This is the phase in which the possible risks must emerge, which, if they 
materialize, would lead to a compromise in terms of the integrity, confidentiality, or availability 
of data.
• Risk measurement: Once the possible risks have been identified, they must be weighed 
according to the impact they would have on the organization. They can be both quantifiable, 
such as monetary impacts (usually in the case of material losses), and immaterial, as in the 
case of damage to reputation.
• Risk weighting: In this step, the results of the previous phase are compared with the risk criteria 
to establish the priorities and methods of risk treatment.
Ultimately, therefore, it is decided how to intervene when risk is encountered and how to proceed. 
The options are as follows:
• Accept the risk if it is not believed to substantially affect the overall risk
• Transfer the risk, where possible, if, for example, it is easier than having to compensate for it 
with mitigation actions
• Cancel the risk, for example, by decommissioning a service if the cost of correcting the risk is 
excessive compared to the actual benefit that this service entails
• Mitigate the risk or implement one or more controls in order to bring the risk back to a value 
that is considered acceptable

p.111 All employees, vendors, and independent contractors should be aware of the following:
• That you have an iSMS and the reasons why
• That you have an information security policy and which portions are applicable to them
• What they must do to assist the company in achieving its information security goals and how 
they may help your firm safeguard its precious information
• Which policies, procedures, and controls are applicable to them and the repercussions 
of noncompliance
• Awareness and comprehension of the following clauses 6.1 – Risk management, 6.2 – iSMS 
goals, 9.1 – Wider measurement and evaluation, 9.2 – Internal audits, 9.3 – Management 
reviews, 10.1 – Non-conformities and remedial measures, as well as continuous improvements 
in accordance with 10.2. (Continual Improvement)
• This information may often be communicated using current procedures and documentation, 
such as orientations, employment contracts, toolbox discussions, supplier agreements, staff 
briefings, and updates

p.116 The standard says that recorded information required by the iSMS, as well as the standard itself, must 
be accessible, usable, and sufficiently safeguarded against destruction or loss of integrity and identity, 
regardless of its internal or external origin. For the correct management of recorded information, the 
organization must provide distribution, retention, access, use, retrieval, preservation, and storage 
methods, as well as control and disposal procedures.
Documented information required by the information security management system and by ISO 27001 
documentation must be appropriately checked to ensure (note: the originating clauses are in brackets):
• iSMS scope (documents) (4.3)
• High-level information security policy (documents) (5.2)
• Risk assessment methodology (documents) (6.1.2)
• Risk assessment report and risk treatments (record) (6.1.2, 6.13, 8.2, 8.3)
• Statement of applicability (documents) (6.1.3 d)
• Information security objectives (documents)( 6.2)
• Evidence of competencies (record) (7.2)
• Documented information as required by the iSMS (documents and record) (7.5.1 b)
• Documents and records required by ISO 27001 (documents and record)( 7.5.1 a)
• Monitoring and measurement results (record)( 9.1)
• Internal audit program aid results (record) (9.2)
• Results of management review (record) (9.3)
• Non-conformances and results and corrective action (record) (10.1)

p.142 Using the ISO 27001 controls
The controls outlined in Annex A of ISO 27001 are a vital component of risk treatment and must be 
chosen based on a comprehensive analysis of an organization’s information security threats.
Typically, chosen controls must be justified by one of the following:
• Risk assessment
• Business need or best method
• Legal or contractual requirement
Once controls have been identified, organizations must submit a Statement of Applicability (SoA) 
that must contain, at a minimum, all 114 controls listed in Annex A of ISO 27001, along with reasons 
for inclusions and, preferably, concise descriptions of how they have been implemented. The SoA acts 
as a tool for providing senior management with accurate information on the degree of risk to which 
their organizations are exposed and the status of risk treatment efforts.

p.172 The most prevalent vishing methods
Cybercriminals often pose as trustworthy individuals, such as bank employees, Internal Revenue 
Service officials, or insurance agents. These fraudsters believe that you will trust these individuals 
enough to grant them access to your accounts or your money. In addition, they are very competent 
at adapting what they say on phone calls based on your location, age, and other particular variables. 
Here are some of the most prevalent approaches:
• In one sort of vishing attack, fraudsters phone you to inform you that your account has been 
hacked and is at risk of a cyber assault. The attacker may next attempt to persuade you to move 
funds from your checking account to a more secure account, or request your login credentials 
in order to resolve the issue. A legitimate bank would never phone a client to urge them to do 
such an action, thus it is better to hang up immediately. Contact your bank if you have any 
doubts about the status of your account.
• Some con artists may phone you and offer you a loan, a reward, or a fantastic investment 
opportunity. In most cases, these offers seem quite advantageous, thus the desire to accept them 
is great. But don’t be fooled: if a contest you’ve never entered requests personal information, 
you may safely hang up. Remember that not everything that glitters is gold; if an offer seems 
too good to be true, then it probably is.
• Tax scams are also popular. Some experienced vishing fraudsters pose as revenue agency officials 
or debt collectors and intimidate victims by discussing outstanding taxes and threatening severe 
penalties. These calls are very annoying but do not be afraid. Even if you have ongoing obligations, 
you should always confirm that the collection agency requesting payment is authorized.
• Social security scams are another common example. Cybercriminals pose as representatives of 
a social security or welfare institution in order to get benefits or pensions, or to steal money. 
Seniors are common victims of these scams because they often live alone and may be unaware 
of the perils of phishing. To protect your loved ones against these scams, have a conversation 
with them, explaining which types of fraud are most prevalent and encouraging them to never 
provide their private information to strangers, especially over the phone

p.175 Have you got a M.A.P.P.?
What exactly is a M.A.P.P.? It is an abbreviation for Mitigation and Prevention Plan. Now, we will 
understand the meaning of M.A.P.P. We need one of these to prevent and prepare for social engineering 
attacks. You can easily set up a M.A.P.P. by following these four steps:
• Learn how to recognize social engineering attacks (by creating a team of professional and 
requesting a third-party company, able to simulate social engineering attacks, to create a realworld scenario)
• Develop realistic and implementable policies
• Conduct periodic real-world audits
• Implement applicable security awareness programs

p.182 Distribution models
In addition to the type of cloud service, the cloud computing distribution model is then defined. In 
this case, the main distribution methods are as follows:
• Public model: Cloud services are made available by an external provider and are available 
to anyone, free or paid. Some examples include Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services.
• Private model: Cloud services are made available for access by a single organization, via the 
internet or a private internal network. The private cloud can be managed by an external provider 
or even internally by the company itself.
• Hybrid model: Cloud services are provided by combining private clouds (third-party or 
in-house) with public clouds as needed, taking advantage of the best of both infrastructures.
• Other models: These include community cloud, multi-cloud, poly cloud, and HPC cloud. 
Without going into detail, suffice it to say that – in addition to the aforementioned – there are 
also other less popular solutions that can be used as needed.

p.183 Cloud security – examples of measures that can prevent risks
Cloud security, as anticipated, concerns a set of strategies aimed at achieving multiple objectives. This 
includes archiving and network protection against cyberattacks, recovering any lost or stolen data, 
and generally reducing the impact of compromised systems or personal data breaches.
Too often, migrations to the cloud are carried out without first evaluating which data and processes 
to move and without having defined cybersecurity measures suitable for your specific case.
Everything must start, therefore, from the awareness of how data has been secured up until now, of 
the infrastructures used, and of the weak points on which it is necessary to intervene. Therefore, have 
a snapshot of the current situation to evaluate which cloud service offers adequate levels of security 
and plan an adequate migration strategy.
Depending on the case and the needs, there are different tools that a company can implement for solid 
cloud security. Here are some examples:
• An Identity and access management (IAM) system, for identity and access management
• Micro-segmentation, thanks to which the implementation of the cloud is divided into distinct 
segments, down to the level of a single workload, minimizing the damage of a possible attacker
• Next-generation firewalls – compared to traditional ones, they add advanced features, such as 
application-aware filters, deep packet inspection, and intrusion prevention systems
• Cryptography so that data can only be decrypted using a specific key
• Threat intelligence, monitoring, and prevention, or features aimed at analyzing traffic to identify, 
block, or at least mitigate a malware attack

p.193 Most US consumers think they are protected until they aren’t. Sadly, customers are unable to observe 
and comprehend the flow of information because this ecosystem is largely opaque and concealed 
from view. Unlike the EU, with its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the United States 
lacks a single legislation that protects the privacy of all kinds of data. Instead, it consists of a variety 
of regulations with acronyms such as HIPAA, FCRA, FERPA, GLBA, ECPA, COPPA, and VPPA that 
are intended to exclusively target particular categories of data in unique (and frequently outmoded) 
situations:
• Only communication between you and covered entities, such as physicians, hospitals, pharmacies, 
insurers, and other such organizations, is covered by the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA), which has little to do with privacy. People tend to think HIPAA 
covers all health data, but it doesn’t. For instance, neither your Fitbit data nor the law’s restrictions 
on who can inquire about your COVID-19 vaccination status are protected.
• Information in your credit report is protected by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). It 
places restrictions on who can access credit reports, what data the credit agencies can gather, 
and how information is acquired.
• Who can seek student educational records is specified in the Family Educational Rights and 
Privacy Act (FERPA). This involves granting the right to view education records kept by a 
school to parents, qualified students, and other schools.
• Consumer financial products, such as loan services or investment advising services, are required 
to disclose how they share data as well as a customer’s choice to opt out under the GrammLeach-Bliley Act (GLBA). As long as they declare such use in advance, the law does not impose 
The US status of privacy 177
restrictions on how businesses utilize the data they acquire. It at least makes an effort to erect 
barriers to the security of some personal information.
• Government wiretapping of phone calls and other electronic signals is prohibited by the 
Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) (although the USA Patriot Act redefined much 
of this). Additionally, it establishes a wide range of guidelines for communication monitoring 
by employers. The ECPA was passed in 1986, and critics frequently point out how out of date 
it is. The ECPA does not defend against contemporary surveillance techniques, including law 
enforcement access to older material saved on servers, in cloud storage documents, and in 
search queries because it was written before the era of the modern internet.
• The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) places restrictions on how much 
information businesses can gather about children under the age of 13 in their databases.
• The sharing of VHS rental records is prohibited by the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA). 
Although it may seem absurd now, this regulation was created as a result of a journalist retrieving 
Robert Bork’s video rental history when he was a candidate for the Supreme Court. However, 
the VPPA hasn’t prevented streaming firms from operating.
• A website or app that violates its own privacy statement may be targeted by the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). The FTC has the 
authority to look into instances of misleading users by claiming that video chats are end-toend encrypted. This is what it did when it filed a complaint against Zoom. Recently, some 
organizations have urged the FTC to extend that authority to unlawful data practices.

p.194 The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) from 2018 and the California Privacy Rights Act
(CPRA), which California voters approved in November 2020, are having a significant impact on 
the landscape of privacy and data security, alongside the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act
(VCDPA) and the Colorado Privacy Act (Colopa or CPA).

p.202 Computer safety
Fortunately, attaining adequate cyber hygiene to thwart the vast majority of intrusions doesn’t necessitate 
cutting-edge equipment or a highly qualified security group. Organizations must just make sure that 
the fundamentals of cyber hygiene are followed. This comprises the following:
• A two-factor authentication (2FA) process. Most credential-based assaults are thwarted by 
multi-factor authentication (MFA) or 2FA. With the kind of passwordless technology that 
is becoming more and more common in contemporary software, this is simpler than ever. 
Wherever it is feasible, MFA should be enabled.
• Least privilege accessibility. Using MFA to protect login to vital accounts is important, but it’s 
also crucial to make sure that each account has access to only the systems they actually require. 
In fact, researchers contend that different accounts should be used for email and internet 
browsing than for accessing privileged systems.
• Maintain device updates. Having the most recent patches and updates from a manufacturer is 
a fundamental necessity for every device connected to a network. Using endpoint management 
software, you can help make sure this occurs throughout the network.
• Install malware-detecting software. Ensuring malware protection software is installed and used in 
addition to more conventional antivirus software is another easy measure to take. This software 
frequently offers both protection from assaults and alerts that an attack is being attempted.
• Safeguard data. All of the aforementioned measures can prove to be quite efficient in protecting 
crucial organizational data, but it’s also crucial that businesses have a clear awareness of the 
data they possess, as well as its relative sensitivity and significance. In fact, this is frequently 
required by laws such as the GDPR and supports a risk-based approach to data governance.

p.206 ISO 27002
The current version of ISO 27002 was issued in 2013 and is now hopelessly out of date. A great deal 
has changed in the last 8 years! Let’s hope we won’t have to wait another 8 years for the next edition.
As with the previous edition, ISO 27002 is meant to be independent in the sense that it may be utilized 
by organizations who are uninterested in ISO 27001 and just want a set of information security rules 
to implement inside their organization. In this regard, it is identical to other control frameworks, such 
as the CSA’s NIST CSF. Choose your poison!
The new version will go out possibly in the upcoming months where the only significant change is 
that Annex A will match the new ISO 27002. This introduces 11 new controls, which are as follows:
• Threat intelligence
• Information security for use of cloud services
• ICT readiness for business continuity
• Physical security monitoring
• Configuration management
• Information deletion
• Data masking
• Data leakage prevention
• Monitoring activities
• Web filtering
• Secure coding
