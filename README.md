<h1>Cybersecurity Literature Repo</h1>

<p>Hey there, fellow cybersecurity enthusiasts! Welcome to my personal collection of awesome cybersecurity literature. I'm a cybersecurity student, like many of you, and I've been diving into some fantastic reads that I think you'll find super interesting and helpful.

In this collection, you'll find books, articles, and resources that cover a range of topics from threat modeling to network security. These are the gems that have been keeping me up at night (in a good way!), and I wanted to share and compile them in a compehensive list.

I'll be updating this list as I come across new and exciting stuff. Whether you're a cybersecurity pro or just getting started, there's something here for everyone.

So, let's learn together and stay ahead of the cybersecurity game. Dive into these reads, and let's make the digital world a safer place, one page at a time!</p>
