<h1>Cybersecurity Literature Repo</h1>

<p>Hey there, fellow cybersecurity enthusiast! Welcome to my personal collection of cybersecurity literature. I'm a cybersecurity student and I've been diving into some reads that I think you'll find interesting and helpful.

In this collection, you'll find books that cover a range of topics from purple teaming to threat modeling. These are the gems that have been keeping me up at night (in a good way!), and I wanted to share and compile them in a compehensive list.

I'll be updating this list as I come across new and exciting stuff. Whether you're a cybersecurity pro or just getting started, there's something here for everyone.

So, let's learn together and stay ahead of the cybersecurity game. Dive into these reads, and let's make the digital world a safer place, one page at a time!</p>
