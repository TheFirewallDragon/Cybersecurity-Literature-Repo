Key Features
Explore red teaming and play the hackers game to proactively defend your infrastructure
Use OSINT, Google dorks, Nmap, recon-nag, and other tools for passive and active reconnaissance
Learn about the latest email, Wi-Fi, and mobile-based phishing techniques
Book Description
Remote working has given hackers plenty of opportunities as more confidential information is shared over the internet than ever before. In this new edition of Mastering Kali Linux for Advanced Penetration Testing, you'll learn an offensive approach to enhance your penetration testing skills by testing the sophisticated tactics employed by real hackers. You'll go through laboratory integration to cloud services so that you learn another dimension of exploitation that is typically forgotten during a penetration test. You'll explore different ways of installing and running Kali Linux in a VM and containerized environment and deploying vulnerable cloud services on AWS using containers, exploiting misconfigured S3 buckets to gain access to EC2 instances.

This book delves into passive and active reconnaissance, from obtaining user information to large-scale port scanning. Building on this, different vulnerability assessments are explored, including threat modeling. See how hackers use lateral movement, privilege escalation, and command and control (C2) on compromised systems.

By the end of this book, you'll have explored many advanced pentesting approaches and hacking techniques employed on networks, IoT, embedded peripheral devices, and radio frequencies.

What you will learn
Exploit networks using wired/wireless networks, cloud infrastructure, and web services
Learn embedded peripheral device, Bluetooth, RFID, and IoT hacking techniques
Master the art of bypassing traditional antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools
Test for data system exploits using Metasploit, PowerShell Empire, and CrackMapExec
Perform cloud security vulnerability assessment and exploitation of security misconfigurations
