p.28 Identifying threat actors and their intent
All around the world, there is a huge demand for cybersecurity professionals as many 
organizations are beginning to understand the need for skilled professionals to help them 
secure and safeguard their assets. One of the most valuable assets to any organization 
is data. Threat actors such as hackers are improving their game plan and hacking has 
become a business on the dark web. Threat actors use advanced and sophisticated attacks 
and threats to compromise their target's systems and networks, steal their data using 
various techniques of exfiltration to bypass threat detection, and sell the stolen data on the 
dark web. 
Years ago, hackers would manually perform these tasks; however, these days they have 
created advanced threats such as ransomware, which is a crypto-malware designed 
to compromise vulnerable systems. Once a system is infected with ransomware, it will 
encrypt all the data within the local drives except the operating system. Additionally, 
ransomware has the capabilities of also compromising any cloud storage that is linked to 
the infected system. For example, imagine a user's system has Google Drive, Microsoft 
OneDrive, or even Dropbox and data is constantly synchronized. If the system is infected, 
the infection could also affect the data within the cloud storage. However, some cloud 
providers have built-in protection against these types of threats. 
Ransomware encrypts the data and holds it hostage while presenting a payment window 
on the victim's desktop requesting payment to recover the data. During this time, the 
responsible threat actor is also exfiltrating your data and selling it on the dark web. 

p.43 Network penetration testing (external and internal)
Network penetration testing focuses on identifying security weaknesses in a targeted 
environment. The penetration test objectives are to identify the flaws in the target 
organization's systems, their networks (wired and wireless), and their networking devices 
such as switches and routers. 
The following are some tasks that are performed using network penetration testing: 
• Bypassing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention 
System (IPS) 
• Bypassing firewall appliances 
• Password cracking 
• Gaining access to end devices and servers 
• Exploiting misconfigurations on switches and routers 
Now that you have a better idea of the objectives of network penetration testing, let's take 
a look at the purpose of cloud penetration testing. 

p.44 Physical penetration testing 
Physical penetration testing focuses on testing the physical security access control systems 
in place to protect an organization's data. Security controls exist within offices and data 
centers to prevent unauthorized persons from entering secure areas of a company. 
Physical security controls include the following: 
• Security cameras and sensors: Security cameras are used to monitor physical 
actions within an area. 
• Biometric authentication systems: Biometrics are used to ensure that only 
authorized people are granted access to an area. 
• Doors and locks: Locking systems are used to prevent unauthorized persons from 
entering a room or area. 
• Security guards: Security guards are people who are assigned to protect something, 
someone, or an area. 

p.46 Gaining access 
This phase can sometimes be the most challenging phase of them all. In this phase, the 
threat actor uses the information obtained from the previous phases to exploit the target. 
Upon successful exploitation of vulnerabilities, the threat actor can then remotely execute 
malicious code on the target and gain remote access to the target system. 
The following can occur once access is gained: 
• Password cracking 
• Exploiting vulnerabilities 
• Escalating privileges 
• Hiding files 
The gaining access (exploitation) phase can at times be difficult as exploits may work 
on one system and not on another. Once an exploit is successful and system access is 
acquired, the next phase is to ensure that you have a persistent connection back to the 
target. 

p.143 Proxychains
A proxy is a system such as a server that sits between a source and a destination host 
on a network. If a sender wants to communicate with a destination server, the sender 
forwards the message to the proxy, which is then forwarded to the destination server. The 
destination server will think the message is originating from the proxy and not the actual 
source. Using proxy servers within the field of IT has many benefits. In cybersecurity, it is 
commonly used to anonymize the origin of network traffic. 
Penetration testers use proxychains, which allow them to create a logical chain of 
connections between multiple proxy servers when sending traffic to a target network or 
the internet. Proxychains allow a penetration tester to configure various types of proxies, 
such as the following:
• HTTP
• HTTPS
• SOCK4
• SOCK5
Simply put, the traffic from the attacker's system will be forwarded to proxyserver1, 
proxyserver2, proxyserver3, and so on until the last server within the chain forwards the 
traffic to the actual target system on the network or internet. Using proxychains does not 
encrypt your traffic compared to VPNs, but it does provide anonymity for your network 
traffic and prevents your real IP addresses from being exposed to the target.

p.174 Open service ports are doorways to a target system, and they indicate whether 
services are running on the device. As shown in the preceding screenshot, the 
following can be determined by a cybersecurity professional and a threat actor:
 Port 21: There's a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server.
 Port 53: This system is providing Domain Name System (DNS) services
 Port 80: There's a web server on this device.
 Port 110: This device is providing Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) services for 
email clients.
 Port 143: This system is running Internet Message Access Protocol 4
(IMAP4) services for email clients. 
 Port 3389: Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) operates on this port 
by default, which means RDP is currently active. 
 Port 8181: Provides email services over this port. 

p.200 There are many public DNS servers on the internet; some are created by threat actors 
with malicious intentions, such as redirecting unaware users to malicious websites. As a 
result, I recommend using a trusted DNS provider on all of your networking devices and 
computers to improve your online safety. The following are some popular DNS servers on 
the internet:
• Cloudflare DNS: https://1.1.1.1/
• Quad 9 DNS: https://www.quad9.net/
• Cisco OpenDNS: https://www.opendns.com/
• Google Public DNS: https://developers.google.com/speed/publicdns
Additionally, DNS servers not only resolve a hostname to an IP address – they also 
contain various records that are used for various types of resolution.
The following are the different record types:
• A: Resolves a hostname to an IPv4 address.
• AAAA: Resolves a hostname to an IPv6 address.
• NS: Contains the name servers' information.
• MX: Contains the mail exchange (email) servers.
• PTR: Resolves an IP address to a hostname.
• CNAME: Provides a canonical name or an alias.
• RP: Specifies the person that's responsible for the domain.
• SOA: Contains information about the administrator of the domain.
• SRV: Contains a service port number for a specific service of the domain.
You're probably thinking, what does learning about DNS have to do with information 
gathering as a penetration tester? As an aspiring penetration tester, DNS enumeration is 
the technique of probing specific DNS records for a specific organization's domain. In 
other words, you ask a DNS server about the IP addresses and server names for a target 
organization. Simply put, you can retrieve both the hostname and the IP addresses of a 
target's public servers, such as their email servers.

p.219 Discovering live hosts on the network is an essential stage when performing a penetration 
test. Let's imagine you're an ethical hacker or a penetration tester; your target organization 
permits you to directly connect your attacker machine with Kali Linux on their network 
to perform security testing from their internal network. You're eager to start discovering 
security vulnerabilities and hacking systems, but you're not sure which systems are online, 
nor their host operating systems. 
In this section, you will learn about the skills you will need to perform various types of 
active reconnaissance on an organization's networks using various tools and techniques. 
However, to ensure you can perform these exercises in a safe space, please use the 
following guidelines:
• Ensure you do not scan systems that you do not own or have been granted legal 
permission. 
• Ensure the network adapter of Kali Linux is assigned to the PentestNet lab network 
within VirtualBox Manager.
• Power on both the Metasploitable 2 and OWASP BWA virtual machines and ensure 
these systems are receiving an IP address on the 172.30.1.0/24 network. 
• The PentestNet network will be our simulated organization network. 

p.225 Whenever a packet is sent from one device to another, the source IP address is included 
within the header of the packet. This is the default behavior of the TCP/IP protocol stack; 
all address details must be included within all packets that need to traverse a network. 
When performing a scan as an ethical hacker and a penetration tester, we try to remain 
undetected by our target organization. During a real cyberattack, if an organization is 
unable to detect suspicious activities on their network and systems, the threat actor can 
simply achieve their objectives without obstructions. However, if an organization can 
detect suspicious activities as soon as they occur, the blue team can take action quickly to 
stop the potential threat and safeguard their systems. 
During a penetration test, it's important to simulate a real-world cyberattack to test 
the threat detection systems within the target organization. While many organizations 
with security solutions help protect them from cyberattacks and threats, not all network 
devices and security solutions are configured properly, so they may not detect a 
penetration tester on their network.

p.239 Over the past few years, cloud computing has become one of the fastest-growing trends 
in the IT industry. Cloud computing allows companies to migrate and utilize computing 
resources within a cloud provider's data center. Cloud computing providers have a pay-asyou-go model, which means that you only pay for the resources you use. Some cloud 
providers allow pay-per-minute schemes, while others use a pay-per-hour structure.
There are some very well-known cloud providers within the industry:
• Amazon Web Services (AWS)
• Microsoft Azure
• Google Cloud
A common service that cloud providers usually offer to customers is a storage facility. 
The AWS storage facility is known as Simple Storage Service (S3). Whenever a customer 
enables the S3 service, a bucket is created. A bucket is a storage unit within the AWS 
platform where the customer can add or remove files. In Microsoft Azure, the file storage 
facility is known as Azure Files. Additionally, on Google Cloud, the storage facility is 
known as Google Cloud Storage

p.280 WPScan
While there are many web applications within the e-commerce industry, there are many 
organizations that deploy the WordPress web application as their preferred Content 
Management System (CMS). While WordPress provides a very stylish and clean 
presentation of websites, many organizations do not update their WordPress platforms 
and plugins, thereby leaving their web server and web application vulnerable to potential 
cyberattacks from threat actors on the internet. 
Within Kali Linux, you will learn about the WPScan tool, which allows penetration testers 
to perform vulnerability scanning and enumeration on the WordPress web application 
on a target server. For this exercise, we will be using the OWASP BWA virtual machine as 
it has a pre-installed WordPress web application located at http://<OWASP BWA IP 
address>/wordpress. 

p.296 The following are various techniques that are used by antivirus 
solutions to detect a potential threat within an application or network traffic:
• Signature-based: Signature-based detection is one of the most common and 
perhaps an older technique that's used by threat detection and prevention systems. 
These techniques allow the antivirus application to look for matching code or 
patterns within a file, software, or network traffic. Once a match has been found, 
an alert is triggered and the antivirus takes action to prevent the threat. The 
disadvantage of using signature-based detection is that the antivirus solution relies 
on knowing the signature of a piece of malware to be able to detect files that contain 
the same malicious code. Without the signature of a new piece of malware, the 
antivirus program will miss the threat.
• Behavioral-based: In behavioral-based threat detection, if an antivirus or 
antimalware program detects a file or an application on a host system to be not 
functioning within normal operating methods, it is placed within a sandbox 
environment. Within this sandbox environment, the potentially harmful application 
is executed within this virtual space, which allows the antivirus and antimalware 
programs to look out for any real potential threats or dangers. 
274 Understanding Network Penetration Testing
• Heuristic-based: In heuristic-based threat detection, the antivirus and antimalware 
program usually need some rules to help it determine whether a file or application 
is harmful to the system or network. Furthermore, algorithms are also used to 
determine whether the executable file or running application has any malicious 
code within its instructions that have the potential to cause harm or data loss on the 
host system.
While antivirus and antimalware vendors usually implement one or more of these 
techniques, the cybersecurity industry is continuously evolving, with new detection 
methods being available in antimalware software. In the following subsections, you 
will learn how to create reverse shell payloads using various techniques to evade threat 
detection systems. 

p.308 Working with wireless adapters
As an aspiring ethical hacker and penetration tester, you may be assigned to perform a 
wireless penetration test on the organization's wireless network infrastructure to discover 
any security vulnerabilities and to assess the resilience of the wireless network. 
While many penetration testers will have Kali Linux deployed on a laptop to improve 
their mobility, using the wireless network interface cards that are built into laptops is 
not the most efficient way to perform wireless penetration testing. Therefore, it's highly 
recommended to use an external wireless network adapter that supports the following 
features:
• IEEE 802.11 operating standards such as 802.11a/b/g/n/ac
• Operating frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz band
• Monitor mode to detect nearby wireless networks
• Packet injection
The following are two wireless network adapters that are commonly used by penetration 
testers:
• The Alfa AWUS036NHA High Gain Wireless B/G/N USB adapter, which supports 
2.4 GHz
• The Alfa AWUS036ACH Long-Range Dual-Band AC1200 Wireless USB 3.0 Wi-Fi 
adapter, which supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz

p.317 Managing and monitoring wireless modes
When working with a wireless network adapter as an ethical hacker or penetration tester, 
it's vital to have a clear understanding of the various modes that you can operate a wireless 
network adapter in. Let's look at each mode of operations that's connected to Kali Linux:
• Managed: This is the default mode for all wireless network adapters. It allows a host 
system such as Kali Linux to connect to an access point or a wireless router. This 
mode does not allow an ethical hacker or penetration tester to perform any type of 
wireless penetration testing technique.
• Monitor: This mode allows ethical hackers and penetration testers to scan for nearly 
IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, capture wireless frames such as beacons and probes, 
and perform packet injection attacks on a target wireless network.
• Master: This mode allows Linux-based systems to operate as access points or 
wireless routers.
• Ad hoc: This mode allows the host system to directly connect to another host 
system, without the need to use an access point or wireless router. Each host will be 
directly connected to the other in the form of a mesh network. 
• Repeater: This mode allows a host device to simply accept an inbound wireless 
signal and reproduce it to other clients on the network. Keep in mind that repeaters 
are typically used to extend the signal coverage of a wireless network.
• Secondary: This mode allows a host to operate as a backup device for a master or 
repeater system.

p.332 The following are various types of password-based attacks:
• Brute force: In a brute force attack, every possible combination is tried against 
the system. This is a very time-consuming process as every possible password 
combination is tested against the authentication system of the target until the valid 
password is retrieved.
• Dictionary attack: In a dictionary attack, the threat actor uses a pre-populated 
wordlist that contains thousands or even millions of possible passwords. These are 
then tested against the authentication system of the target. Each word from the 
wordlist is tested; however, the attack will not be successful if a valid password is not 
found within the wordlist being used by the threat actor.
• Password guessing: This is a common technique that's used by many people, even 
threat actors and penetration testers, who are attempting to gain unauthorized 
access to a system. I have often seen IT professionals use simple and even default 
passwords on their networking devices, security appliances, and even the client and 
server systems within their organization.
• Password cracking: In this technique, the threat actor uses various tools and 
techniques to retrieve valid user credentials to gain unauthorized access to a system. 
Sometimes, a threat actor may capture a user's password while it's being transmitted 
across a network in plaintext by an insecure network protocol, or even retrieve the 
cryptographic hash of a password.
• Password spraying: This is the technique where a threat actor uses a single 
password and tests it against an authentication system with different usernames. The 
idea is to test which user account within a specific list uses a single password. This 
technique is good when testing which users within the organization's network use 
weak or common passwords.
• Credential stuffing: This technique allows a threat actor to use a common wordlist 
of usernames and passwords against the authentication system of a target host. This 
technique checks which combination of usernames and passwords are valid user 
credentials.
• Online password attack: In an online password attack, the threat actor attempts 
to gain unauthorized access to a hostSPACEthat is running a network service. This 
allows authorized users to log into the system across a network. A simple example of 
an online password attack is a threat actor attempting to retrieve the username and 
password of a valid user to gain access to a server that is running RDP.
310 Performing Network Penetration Testing
• Offline password attack: In an offline password attack, the threat actor uses various 
tools and techniques to retrieve the valid password of a password-protected file, 
such as a document or even the cryptographic hash of a user's password. A simple 
example of this is capturing a domain administrator's username and password hash 
from network packets. The username is usually in plaintext, but you may need/want 
to retrieve the password from the hash value.

p.592 Elements of social engineering
Being excellent at social engineering takes a bit of time to develop as a skill. One of the key 
aspects of being a good people person is communicating effectively with anyone, whether 
in person, over the telephone, or even using a digital medium such as emails or instant 
messaging. Being a good people person usually means being able to interpret a person's 
mood and mindset during a conversation and even determine whether the person trusts 
easily or not. Using social engineering as a penetration tester, you need to understand 
a person's emotional intelligence based on their tone of voice, body language, gestures, 
choice of words, and even how easily they may develop trust during a conversation. While 
this may sound a bit complicated, it's mostly about being able to quickly interpret and 
predict a person's reaction based on a situation during a conversation. I'm sure you have 
already noticed your friends, colleagues, and even family members' reactions during 
various types of conversations on occasion. Being observant, interpretational, and having 
a good situational awareness mindset will be beneficial during social engineering.
To ensure you are excellent at social engineering, the following are the key elements that 
are commonly used by threat actors and penetration testers: 
• Authority – During a social engineering attack, a threat actor may pretend to 
be someone of high authority within the target organization. Imagine that the 
threat actor calls the customer service department of their target organization and 
informs the agent that they are calling from the IT helpdesk and require their user 
credentials to perform a system configuration change on their computer. 
• Intimidation – Threat actors use intimidation to drive fear into their potential 
victim's mind if they do not perform the instructed task or provide the requested 
information. Imagine a user doesn't want to provide the user credentials to their 
system. A threat actor may inform the user that if they do not provide their 
username and password now, their system will be affected and may be compromised 
by possible malware, and their manager will be upset at the lack of cooperation.
• Consensus – This element allows threat actors to use social proof that an action 
is considered to be normal because others are doing the same thing. The threat 
actor may inform the potential victim that other users within their department 
or organization had no issues providing their user credentials; their systems are 
configured and upgraded.
Types of social engineering 569
• Scarcity – This factor is used to inform the potential victims that an event needs to 
be completed within a specific time, such as immediately. A threat actor may inform 
the potential victim that if they do not provide their user credentials now, the time 
to perform the system configurations or upgrade will not be available in the future.
• Urgency – Applying urgency into a situation usually implies the importance of 
a task. Threat actors commonly apply urgency during a social engineering attack 
to convince the potential victim of the importance of providing the requested 
information or performing a task. 
• Familiarity – This element is used by threat actors to build some type of familiarity 
or relationship between themselves and the potential victim. Threat actors may 
discuss a potentially mutual friend, a sporting event, or anything that ensures the 
potential victim opens to the conversation and starts trusting the threat actor.
• Trust – Establishing trust during a social engineering exercise increases the 
likelihood of the attack being successful. Threat actors can use various choices of 
words to build a trusting relationship with the potential victim. Once the trusting 
relationship is created, the threat actor can exploit the trust and get the potential 
victim to reveal confidential information easily and even perform tasks.

p.593 Human-based
In human-based social engineering, the threat actor or penetration tester usually 
pretends to be someone with authority, such as a person who is important within the 
organization. This means the threat actor can attempt to impersonate a director or senior 
member of staff and request a password change on the victim's user account. An easy 
form of impersonation that usually gets a user to trust you quickly is posing as technical 
support. Imagine calling an employee while you're pretending to be an IT person from the 
organization's helpdesk team and requesting the user to provide their user account details. 
Usually, end users are not always aware of human-based threats in cybersecurity and 
would quickly trust someone who is pretending to be technical support.
The following are additional types of attacks related to human-based social engineering:
• Eavesdropping – Eavesdropping involves listening to conversations between people 
and reading their messages without authorization. This form of attack includes 
the interception of any transmission between users, such as audio, video, or even 
written communication.
• Shoulder surfing – Shoulder surfing is looking over someone's shoulder while they 
are using their computer. This technique is used to gather sensitive information, 
such as PINs, user IDs, and passwords. Additionally, shoulder surfing can be done 
from longer ranges, using devices such as digital cameras.
• Dumpster diving – Dumpster diving is a form of human-based social engineering 
where the attacker goes through someone else's trash, looking for sensitive/
confidential data. Victims insecurely disposing of confidential items, such as 
corporate documents, expired credit cards, utility bills, and financial records, are 
considered to be valuable to an attacker.

p.594 The following are common types of computer-based social engineering:
• Phishing – Attackers usually send an illegitimate email containing false information 
while masking it to look like a legitimate email from a trusted person or source. 
This technique is used to trick a user into providing personal information or other 
sensitive details.
Imagine receiving an email that includes your bank's name as the sender name and 
the body of the email has instructions informing you to click on a provided link to 
reset your online banking credentials. Email messages are usually presented to us 
in Rich Text Format, which provides very clean and easy-to-read text. This format 
hides the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) code of the actual message 
and displays human-readable plain text instead. Consequently, an attacker can 
easily mask the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to send the user to a malicious
website. The recipient of the phishing email may not be able to identify misleading 
or tampered-with details and click on the link.
• Spear phishing – In a regular phishing attack, the attacker sends hundreds of 
generic email messages to random email addresses over the internet. With spear 
phishing, the attacker sends specially crafted messages to a specific group of people. 
Spear-phishing attacks have higher response rates compared to normal phishing 
attacks because the emails are crafted to seem more believable than others.
• Whaling – Whaling is another type of computer-based social engineering 
attack. Similar to phishing, a whaling attack is designed to target the high-profile 
employees of a target organization. High-profile employees usually have high 
authority in both their job duties and their computer accounts. Compromising 
a high-profile employee's user account can lead to the threat actor reading 
confidential emails, requesting information from various departments such as 
financial records, and even changes within the IT infrastructure to permit remote 
access for the threat actor.
• Pharming – This is a type of social engineering where the attacker is able to 
manipulate the Domain Name System (DNS) records on either a victim's system 
or DNS server. Changing the DNS records will ensure users are redirected to a 
malicious website rather than visiting the legitimate website. A user who wants 
to visit a website such as www.example.com may be redirected to www.
malciouswebsite.com with a different IP address. This technique is used to 
send a lot of users to malicious or fake websites to gather sensitive information, 
such as user credentials from unaware site visitors.
572 Performing Client-Side Attacks – Social Engineering 
• Water hole – In this type of attack, the threat actor observes where employees 
of a target organization are commonly visiting such as a website. The threat actor 
will create a fake, malicious clone of the website and attempt to redirect the users 
to the malicious website. This technique is used to compromise all of the website 
visitors' devices and not just the employees of the target organization. This attack 
helps the threat actor to compromise a target organization that has very strict 
security controls, such as DiD. This type of attack helps hackers to perform 
credential harvesting, which is used to gather users' credentials.

p.613 The HTTP response usually contains a lot of information that helps penetration testers 
determine whether the web application is secure or not. The following is a breakdown of 
the information found within the preceding screenshot:
• The first line contains the protocol (HTTP) and its version (1.1), HTTP Status code 
(200), and the status message (OK).
• Content-Type – This informs the client how to interpret the body of the HTTP 
response message.
• Content-Length – This specifies the length of the message in bytes.
• Date – This contains the date and time of the response from the server.
The following is a list of HTTP status codes and their descriptions:
• HTTP status code 100:
 Code 100 – Continue
 Code 101 – Switching protocol
 Code 102 – Processing
 Code 103 – Early hints
• HTTP status code 200:
 Code 200 – OK
 Code 201 – Created
 Code 204 – No content
Understanding web applications 591
• HTTP status code 300:
 Code 301 – Moved permanently
 Code 302 – Found
 Code 304 – Not modified
 Code 307 – Temporary redirect
 Code 308 – Permanent redirect
• HTTP status code 400:
 Code 400 – Bad request
 Code 401 – Unauthorized
 Code 403 – Forbidden
 Code 404 – Not found
 Code 409 – Conflict
• HTTP status code 500:
 Code 500 – Internal server conflict
 Code 501 – Not implemented
 Code 502 – Bad gateway
 Code 503 – Service unavailable
 Code 504 – Gateway timeout
 Code 599 – Network timeout

p.615 Over the years, OWASP has published a list of the top security vulnerabilities that exist 
within web applications from community research. This list has come to be known as the 
OWASP Top 10, which contains the details of the most severe and critical security risks 
within web applications. As mentioned, over time this list is modified to highlight the 
most critical security risks, and as of 2021, the following are the OWASP Top 10: 2021
security risks in web applications:
1. A01:2021 – Broken access control
2. A02:2021 – Cryptographic failures
3. A03:2021 – Injection
4. A04:2021 – Insecure design
5. A05:2021 – Security misconfiguration 
6. A06:2021 – Vulnerable and outdated components
7. A07:2021 – Identification and authentication failures
