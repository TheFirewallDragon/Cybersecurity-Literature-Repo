Book Description
With the increased demand for computer systems and the ever-evolving internet, network security now plays an even bigger role in securing IT infrastructures against attacks. Equipped with the knowledge of how to find vulnerabilities and infiltrate organizations through their networks, you'll be able to think like a hacker and safeguard your organization's network and networking devices. Network Protocols for Security Professionals will show you how.

This comprehensive guide gradually increases in complexity, taking you from the basics to advanced concepts. Starting with the structure of data network protocols, devices, and breaches, you'll become familiar with attacking tools and scripts that take advantage of these breaches. Once you've covered the basics, you'll learn about attacks that target networks and network devices. Your learning journey will get more exciting as you perform eavesdropping, learn data analysis, and use behavior analysis for network forensics. As you progress, you'll develop a thorough understanding of network protocols and how to use methods and tools you learned in the previous parts to attack and protect these protocols.

By the end of this network security book, you'll be well versed in network protocol security and security countermeasures to protect network protocols.
