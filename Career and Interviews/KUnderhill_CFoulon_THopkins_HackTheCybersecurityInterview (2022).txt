Final Thoughts

''Hacking Yourself''

p.25 Instead, what the interviewer wants to hear is a brief summary of your career 
with a focus on your impact on past employers. Think of this as your 30-second 
elevator pitch.
Here's an example:
From the job posting, it's clear the person in this Security Operations Center
(SOC) analyst role needs to be ready to go on day one and deliver results fast. That's 
what I've been able to do at Acme Inc. I developed a new SIEM tool for them within 
60 days of hire and created an automation program that reduced false positives by 
12%. Would you like to hear more about anything I've mentioned so far?

I would say my greatest strength is the ability to break down technical information 
and present it in an easily digestible format for stakeholders across an organization.

What is your greatest weakness?
With this question, I would typically just bring up a weakness they already know 
about and then end with some of the value I bring to an organization. I work too 
hard would be a dumb answer here. The interviewer is typically trying to assess your 
self-awareness with this question

p.26 This one is usually asked as Where do you see yourself in 5 years? Some people will 
tell you to answer I see myself working in your position, which is a dumb idea in 
my opinion. That puts the interviewer on the defense, and you want to keep them 
relaxed and liking you. I used to answer this one and then ask the interviewer a 
question. The more you can keep the interview a conversation and not an interview, 
the better off you are.

p.27 Which key performance indicators (KPIs) would you have for me in this 
position over the first 30, 60, and 90 days?
What kind of person succeeds at this company?
What do you enjoy most about working at this company?
What do you see as my greatest strengths for this position?

p.29 My favorite definition of cybersecurity comes from Dr. Mansur Hasib's best-selling book, 
Cybersecurity Leadership, as follows:
"Cybersecurity is the mission-focused and risk-optimized governance of information, which 
maximizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability using a balanced mix of people, policy, 
and technology, while perennially improving over time." (Hasib, 2015, p. 3)

p.31 personal branding, work as a team

p.62 Penetration testing (pentesting) or ethical hacking is where you assess the security of 
networks, websites, endpoints, mobile devices, wireless devices, operational technology/
industrial control system (OT/ICS) infrastructure, and the security of physical facilities. 
This assessment might include performing vulnerability scanning and analysis, reviewing 
source code, performing open source intelligence (OSINT), gaining access to a target by 
exploiting vulnerabilities, escalating privileges, maintaining persistence, and more.
A key thing here is that you have permission as a pentester to attack the target as defined
in the statement of work (SOW) of the penetration test (pentest). If you don't have 
permission, then it's illegal. Before starting action on any pentest, you need to review the 
rules of engagement (ROEs) and determine the scope of the pentest and verify that the 
client owns everything listed. I've reviewed SOWs before where the client mistyped an 
Internet Protocol (IP) address and we could have been in legal trouble for performing 
the pentest if we had not corrected the documentation. The right documentation is like a 
get-out-of-jail-free card during a pentest.

• Do you have a favorite hacker in history, and why are they your favorite?

What do you do next?

dangerous?

p.195 Behavioral interview questions are asked to help the interviewer gain insight into how 
you have handled past situations at work, which can help them see how you might handle 
similar situations in their company.
When answering behavioral interview questions, I recommend you use something such as 
the S.T.A.R. technique, which stands for situation, task, action, and result.
For the situation strand, you want to describe the situation you were in and set the scene 
for the interviewer. For the task strand, describe the issue or situation that you were 
confronted with. For action, describe the intervention or action you did in the situation. 
And, finally, for the result strand, tell the interviewer how your actions solved the problem 
and how you helped the company. When you answer, try to be clear and concise and 
use quantifiable results wherever possible. For example, your action during the situation 
might have resulted in a 20 percent reduction in IT support tickets, so be sure to mention 
this fact to the interviewer

p.240 Finally, I want to leave you with sort of an affirmation I created for myself a while back. 
Sometimes, we work so hard to achieve our goals that we are too hard on ourselves and 
push a bit more than we should. I'm guilty of this as well so I've recently developed the 
habit of reminding myself to give myself grace. From my perspective, G.R.A.C.E. is a 
package deal, and on certain days I have to embody some of these mindsets more than 
others, but the total package keeps me grounded. I'll share its contents with you:
• Grit: 
 Official definition: The passion and perseverance for long-term and meaningful 
goals.
 Tia's translation: DON'T QUIT.
• Resilience:
 Official definition: The ability to recover from a setback, adapt well to change, and 
keep going in the face of adversity.
 Tia's translation: ALWAYS GET UP.
• Agility:
 Official definition: The ability to think and understand quickly.
 Tia's translation: BE QUICK ON YOUR FEET.
222 Final Thoughts
• Curiosity:
 Official definition: A strong desire to learn or know something.
 Tia's translation: NEVER STOP LEARNING.
• Empowerment:
 Official definition: The knowledge, confidence, means, or ability to do things or 
make decisions for yourself.
 Tia's translation: ASK FOR FORGIVENESS, NOT PERMISSION.
