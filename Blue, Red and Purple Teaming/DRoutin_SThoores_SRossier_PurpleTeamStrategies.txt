Ensure the ultimate effectiveness of an organization's red and blue teams with practical tips
Book Description
With small to large companies focusing on hardening their security systems, the term "purple team" has gained a lot of traction over the last couple of years. Purple teams represent a group of individuals responsible for securing an organization's environment using both red team and blue team testing and integration – if you're ready to join or advance their ranks, then this book is for you.

Purple Team Strategies will get you up and running with the exact strategies and techniques used by purple teamers to implement and then maintain a robust environment. You'll start with planning and prioritizing adversary emulation, and explore concepts around building a purple team infrastructure as well as simulating and defending against the most trendy ATT&CK tactics. You'll also dive into performing assessments and continuous testing with breach and attack simulations.

Once you've covered the fundamentals, you'll also learn tips and tricks to improve the overall maturity of your purple teaming capabilities along with measuring success with KPIs and reporting.

With the help of real-world use cases and examples, by the end of this book, you'll be able to integrate the best of both sides: red team tactics and blue team security measures.

What you will learn
