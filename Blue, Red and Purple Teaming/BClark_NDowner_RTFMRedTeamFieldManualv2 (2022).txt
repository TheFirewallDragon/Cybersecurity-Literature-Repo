Over 8 years ago, the Red Team Field Manual (RTFM) was born out of operator field notes inspired by years of Red Team missions. While tools and techniques change, operators still constantly find themselves in common operating environments, with time running out. The RTFM has provided a quick reference when there is no time to scour the Internet for that perfect command.

RTFM version 2 has been completely overhauled, with the addition of over 290 new commands and techniques. It has also been thoroughly updated and tested to ensure it works against modern operating systems. Version 2 includes a new Mac OS section and a section outlining tradecraft considerations. Searching has been streamlined through an expanded table of contents and appendix, and readability has been considerably improved through new text formatting. Finally, RTFM v2 will come in multiple formats including paperback, hardback (coming August 2022), Kindle eBook and an all-new wide margin note taking edition.
